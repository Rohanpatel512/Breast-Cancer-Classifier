# Breast-Cancer-Classifier

## Description
Breast Cancer Classification Model is a machine learning project that classifies breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign based on various diagnostic features. The model uses a Breast Cancer Dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on factors like texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness of the tumor's cells. 

## Key Findings
 - Malginant tumors have larger sizes and more irregular shapes (higher concativity and compactness).
